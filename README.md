I'm a Civil Engineer graduated in La Sapienza (Rome), i like programming and discovering new things.

My favourite programming languages are C and Rust.
I'm studying DSA with implementations in C.
I like machine learning and artificial intelligence (self-taught), and i'm trying to implement basic algorithms from scratch in Rust (KNN, linear regression etc..).
